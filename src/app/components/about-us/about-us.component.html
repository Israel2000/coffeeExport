        <h2>Welcome to Titus Coffee</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="">At Titus Coffee, we specialize in sourcing the finest single-origin green coffee from Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee. As a dedicated green coffee importer, we connect farmers with roasters with ethically sourced beans that highlight Ethiopia’s rich coffee heritage and diverse flavor profiles.</p>
        <p>Our commitment goes beyond coffee—we build sustainable partnerships with Ethiopian farmers, ensuring fair prices, ethical trade, and environmentally responsible practices. By working directly with producers and cooperatives, we bring you traceable, specialty-grade coffee that reflects the unique terroir of each region, from the floral notes of Yirgacheffe to the bold richness of Sidamo.</p>
        <p>Whether you're a specialty roaster seeking unique microlots or a business in need of consistent, high-quality supply, we provide fresh, unroasted beans tailored to your needs. Fairly traded. Ethically sourced. Roasted to perfection.</p>

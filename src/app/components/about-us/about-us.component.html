Sidamo coffee bean profile 

Sidamo green coffee beans originate from the Sidamo region in southern Ethiopia, one of the most renowned coffee-growing areas in the world. Grown at high elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,200 meters (4,900 to 7,200 feet) above sea level, these beans benefit from the region’s fertile soil, ample rainfall, and ideal climate. Sidamo coffee is known for its bright acidity, medium body, and complex flavor profile, often featuring floral, citrus, and berry notes with a tea-like finish. These high-altitude conditions contribute to the slow maturation of the coffee cherries, enhancing their rich and distinctive flavors.
